<h1>Introduction to Network Theorems in Electrical Engineering</h1>
<div style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-align: justify; font-size: large;" >
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Electric circuit theorems are always beneficial to help find voltage and currents in multi-loop circuits. 
    These theorems use fundamental rules or formulas and basic equations of mathematics to analyze basic 
    components of electrical or electronics parameters such as voltages, currents, resistance, and so on. 
    These fundamental theorems include the basic theorems like Superposition theorem, Tellegen’s theorem, 
    Norton’s theorem, Maximum power transfer theorem, and Thevenin’s theorems. Another group of network 
    theorems that are mostly used in the circuit analysis process includes the Compensation theorem, 
    Substitution theorem, Reciprocity theorem, Millman’s theorem, and Miller’s theorem.
  </p>
  <h2>1. Super Position Theorem</h2>
  <p>The Superposition theorem is a way to determine the currents and voltages present in a 
    circuit that has multiple sources (considering one source at a time). The superposition 
    theorem states that in a linear network having a number of voltage or current sources and 
    resistances, the current through any branch of the network is the algebraic sum of the currents 
    due to each of the sources when acting independently.
  </p>

  <h6>Super Position Theorem</h6>
  <p>Superposition theorem is used only in linear networks. This theorem is used in both AC and DC 
    circuits wherein it helps to construct Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuit.</p>
  <p>In the above figure, the circuit with two voltage sources is divided into two individual 
    circuits according to this theorem’s statement. The individual circuits here make the whole 
    circuit look simpler in easier ways. And, by combining these two circuits again after individual simplification, 
    one can easily find parameters like voltage drop at each resistance, node voltages, currents, etc.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Thevenin’s Theorem</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Statement:</b> A linear network consisting of a number of voltage sources and resistances can be replaced 
    by an equivalent network having a single voltage source called Thevenin’s voltage (Vthv) and a single 
    resistance called (Rthv).
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/11.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Thevenin’s Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    The above figure explains how this theorem is applicable for circuit analysis. Thevinens voltage is calculated by the given 
    formula between the terminals A and B by breaking the loop at the terminals A and B. Also, Thevinens resistance or 
    equivalent resistance is calculated by shorting voltage sources and open 
     circuiting current sources as shown in the figure.
  </p>
  <p>
    This theorem can be applied to both linear and bilateral networks. It 
    is mainly used for measuring the resistance with a Wheatstone bridge.
  </p>
  <h2>
    3. Norton’s Theorem
  </h2>
  <p>
    This theorem states that any linear circuit containing several energy sources and resistances can 
    be replaced by a single constant current generator in parallel with a single resistor.
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nnn.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Norton’s Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    This is also the same as that of the Thevinens theorem, in which we find Thevinens 
    equivalent voltage and resistance values, but here current equivalent values are determined. 
    The process of finding these values is shown as given in the example within the above figure.
  </p>
  <h2>
    4. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
  </h2>
  <p>
    This theorem explains the condition for the maximum power transfer to 
    load under various circuit conditions. The theorem states that the power transfer by a source to a load is
     maximum in a network when the load resistance is equal to the internal resistance of the source
     . For AC circuits load impedance should match with the source impedance for maximum power transfer even if
      the load is operating at different power factors.
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/21.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>For instance, the above figure depicts a circuit diagram wherein a circuit is simplified up to a 
    level of source with internal resistance using Thevenin’s theorem. The power transfer will be maximum 
    when this Thevinens resistance is equal to the load resistance. The Practical application of this theorem 
    includes an audio system wherein the resistance of the speaker must be matched to the audio power amplifier 
    to obtain maximum output.
  </p>
  <h2>5. Reciprocity Theorem</h2>
  <p>
    Reciprocity theorem helps to find the other corresponding solution even without further work, once the circuit is 
    analyzed for one solution. The theorem states that in a linear passive bilateral network, the excitation source and
     its corresponding response can be interchanged.
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Reciprocity Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    In the above figure, the current in the R3 branch is I3 with a single source Vs. If this source is replaced to the 
    R3 branch and shorting the source at the original location, then the current flowing from the original 
    location I1is the same as that of I3. This is how we can find corresponding solutions for the circuit once 
    the circuit is analyzed with one solution.
  </p>
  <h2>
    6. Compensation Theorem
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/7.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Compensation Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    In any bilateral active network, if the amount of impedance is changed from the 
    original value to some other value carrying a current of I, then the resulting changes that occur in other branches are same as 
    those that would have been caused by the injection voltage source in the modified branch with a negative sign, i.e., minus of voltage
     current and changed impedance product. The four figures given above show how this compensation theorem is applicable
      in analyzing the circuits.
  </p>
  <h2>
    7. Millman’s Theorem
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/5.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Millman’s Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    This theorem states that when any number of voltage sources 
    with finite internal resistance is operating in parallel can be replaced with a single voltage source
     with series equivalent impedance. The Equivalent voltage for these parallel sources with internal sources in
      Millman’s theorem is calculated by the below-given formula, which is shown in the above figure.
  </p>
  <h2>8. Tellegen’s theorem</h2>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/6.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Tellegen’s theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    This theorem is applicable for circuits with a linear or nonlinear, passive, or active and hysteric or non-hysteric networks. 
    It states that the summation of instantaneous power in the circuit with n number of branches is zero.
  </p>
  <h2>
    9. Substitution Theorem
  </h2>
  <div>
    <center><iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CURpzrOmPHs" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </center>
  </div>
  <h6>
    Substitution Theorem Video
  </h6>
  <p>
    This theorem states that any branch in a network can be substituted by a different branch 
    without disturbing the currents and voltages in the whole network provided the new branch has
     the same set of terminal voltages and current as of the original branch. The substitution theorem can
      be used in both linear and nonlinear circuits.
  </p>
  <h2>
    10. Miller’s Theorem
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mmm.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <h6>
    Miller’s Theorem
  </h6>
  <p>
    This theorem states that in a linear circuit if a branch exists with 
    impedance Z connected between two nodes with nodal voltages, this branch can be replaced by two
     branches connecting the corresponding nodes to the ground by two impedances. The
      application of this theorem is not only an effective tool for creating an equivalent circuit but also a tool for designing modified additional
       electronic circuits by impedance.
  </p>
  <p>These are all basic network theorems used widely in the electrical or electronic circuit analysis. 
    We hope that you might have got some basic ideas about all these theorems.
